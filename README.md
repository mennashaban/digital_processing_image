# Digital_Processing_Image

## Task 1
Build your framework for Signal processing. [USING PYTHON]
Add to it the following features: 
The ability to read samples of a signal from a txt file and display it in both continuous and discrete representations.
The ability to generate sinusoidal or cosinusoidal signals, the user should choose whether he wants cosine or sine, the amplitude A, the phase shift theta, the analog frequency, and the sampling frequency needed. (Hint: the sampling frequency chosen should obey the sampling theorem). Your framework should include a menu named Signal Generation with two items sine wave and cosine wave. 

Your framework should have the ability to display two signals at same time.
